# oblig-repo
This is a project regarding input validation and implementation. It consists of a locally hosted website where you can choose a movie, and write a number of tickets and some pruchaser information and register it if it's valid.

## Installation
Download the zip-file from github and unzip it where you see fit. Then choose a preffered browser and open index.html in it.

## Registering purchases
After writing down the necessary information you can hit a button labeled "Register purchases," your inputs will then be validated. If all inputs are valid they will get registered and shown at the bottom of the page. If any of the inputs are invalid the purchase will not be registered, all invalid inputs will be removed and you'll get text telling you to you to do it properly.

## Removing purchases
Another button labeled "Remove all purchases" will clear the bottom part of the page of all purchases.
